If there are multiple members in your party and each wishes to use a voucher then each member must request a separate bill.  Obtaining one bill and asking for it to be split when you pay will still count as one transaction meaning only one voucher can be redeemed.  Each member is limited to using one voucher every 5 hours regardless of restaurant type.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"line-height:1.5\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">5.

Should the purchase total come to less than the value of the redemption voucher then no change will be given.

Should the purchase total come to less than the value of the redemption voucher then no change will be given.

A member can only use one voucher per transaction. If there are multiple members in your party and each wishes to use a voucher then each member must request a separate bill.  Obtaining one bill and asking for it to be split when you pay will still count as one transaction meaning only one voucher can be redeemed.  Each member is limited to using one voucher every 5 hours regardless of restaurant type.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"line-height:1.5\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">5.

A member can only use one voucher per transaction. If there are multiple members in your party and each wishes to use a voucher then each member must request a separate bill.  Obtaining one bill and asking for it to be split when you pay will still count as one transaction meaning only one voucher can be redeemed.  Each member is limited to using one voucher every 5 hours regardless of restaurant type.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"line-height:1.5\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">5.

The voucher cannot be used in conjunction with any other offers, entitlements, discounts, vouchers or promotions.  Redemption of the voucher is subject to availability and does not guarantee access, table reservations or bookings at a participating restaurant, access to the restaurant is at the restaurant’s sole discretion.  We shall not be held liable if your chosen restaurant is unavailable. </span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"line-height:1.5\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">7. The restaurants participating in this scheme may be added or removed at any time without prior notice.  If a voucher is no longer showing as available to select on the  App or website, it is no longer valid.  If you select a voucher in advance of your visit to the airport it is your responsibility to check that it is still available on the App or website on the date of your visit.  If it is not, the voucher will not be eligible for redemption.</span></span></p><br><p><span style=\"line-height:1.5\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">8.
